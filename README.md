It's been a long time coming, but I've finally gotten around to creating a brand new
blog-style template (and the first since Striped, which came out waaaaay back in 2013).
Anyway, Future Imperfect features a clean, expansive layout, a toggleable search box,
and -- because pretty much all modern browsers can use it now -- a whole lot of flexbox
action. Enjoy it :)
